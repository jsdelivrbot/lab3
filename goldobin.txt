Nikolay Goldobin heads for Utica after training camp cut
SEPTEMBER 29, 2017, 11:11 AM | CAT SILVERMAN
The Vancouver Canucks picked up forward Nikolay Goldobin from the San Jose Sharks last season, acquiring the former first rounder for veteran and Danish wonder Jannik Hansen.

Goldobin was considered to be a promising pickup for Vancouver. The Moscow native had put up 21 points in 38 games in the highest Finnish league in his post-draft season, then went on to boast 44 points in 60 AHL games during his first North American season.

After leaving the Sharks with 41 points in 46 AHL games for the San Jose Barracuda prior to his trade last year, it was hoped that Goldobin would be ready for the NHL full-time this season.

Unfortunately, that’s not looking like the case.

It was reported on Friday, via Rick Dhaliwal of Sportsnet 650, that Goldobin has been cut from preseason training camp and assigned to the AHL’s Utica Comets. That means that, barring a catastrophic injury to multiple Vancouver forwards before the start of the year, he’ll get the new season started in the minors – again.

Standing at just 5-foot-11 and 185 lbs, Goldobin is a fast, purely offensive talent who doesn’t have any qualms admitting that’s exactly what he is.

Unfortunately, that lack of a two-way game doesn’t bode well in Vancouver, where the team is looking for him to show that he’s got the initiative to be a bit more well-rounded before they bring him up full-time. That may not be fair (or, to you, it might be exactly what the team needs to do), but it is what it is.

If he can show a bit more willingness to work on his defensive awareness in Utica, though, there’s little reason to believe that Goldobin won’t find his way up in Vancouver at some point during the year.

Not much of a surprise he was sent down but I still think he’ll be an NHL player next year if not sooner.

I was hoping he would play in the game against Edmonton this weekend. Unfortunately that will not happen. I expect he will be back before too long. He is a talent – seems to need a little conditioning.

Trade him for Anderson before he bolts to KHL. May be a better fit playing with Panarin as well. Do it.

Clearly the correct decision but I hope he handles it well. He’s probably first in line for a call up for any of the offensive winger spots, but he’ll need to demonstrate a pro attitude and preparation in the AHL to earn that. But once he gets into the lineup I think he has the game to make it hard to take him out and could force some roster decisions from management. They signed a bunch of FAs to light this fire but they can’t keep it burning forever, so somebody will have to be moved eventually, and whether that’s a veteran or a prospect depends on how things go in the first third of the season or so.

I think Ownership pressured Benning to sign Erickson in order to sell tickets. Either way, I think that signing is going to plague the team for years. Eating up a roster spot for young talent at a position they are loaded in (prospects on the cusp), and taking up a ton of cap space.

I have no problem with Goldobin being sent down but when does he come up? He’s already put up good numbers in the A and even if he does so again, there’s nowhere for him to go. Bouncing back and forth with injuries isn’t ideal either.

Hopefully a prospect steps up in Utica and the Canucks make room for them at the deadline.

True. The Erickson signing was probably Benning’s worst move so far. Didn’t understand it at the time, and it doesn’t look any better now.

How was it a bad signing when the team was bereft of talent at the time other than the Sedins, who were slowing down? Hindsight is always 20/20. While the contract is long and salary large, that is the cost of playing in the free agent pool where a team gives up nothing in return for the signing.

Apologies Bob. Worst move doesn’t equate to bad signing.  ??

This shouldn’t be a surprise, he’s a purely offensive guy who hasn’t been very offensive this preseason. If he had put up a lot of points, he may have forced his way on the team.

This is the real test for Goldobin: does he handle the adversity of being sent to Utica by ripping up the AHL and forcing a call-up or does he pout?

Everything I’ve seen from Goldy says he’ll never be NHL ready. He doesn’t work hard defensively, he’s on the small side and although he’s flashy, he just doesn’t seem to put the puck in the net very often.

Now he’s complaining about getting sent down after being invisible for most of the pre-season? If he can ever get his head out of his own ass and recognize he’s got to work hard and contribute in all phases of the game, he could make a decent middle six guy. If he keeps this prima donna attitude without the skills, he’s going to be a year or two in the AHL before he tucks tail and runs home to the KHL where he can be the star he imagines he is.

It’s no wonder SJ offloaded him on us.

The Canucks have extra wingers. Time to get on the phone Jimbo. Vanek, Ericksson and Dorsett are all expendable. Deal for whatever draft picks you can get, retain some salary if needed but make the room you promised. Package Rodin or Goldobin with a 3rd rd pick for an extra 1st rounder. Do it now while all the teams still believe they will be picking very late.

Tough crowd. He’s still very young and has a typical knock against him, needs to play better without the puck and be consistent in his habits. Not a big worry, it’s a pretty standard learning curve.

The whole attitude overblown, I’m glad he’s not happy about being sent down. Let’s hope it lights a fire, Cull gives him lots of attention and teaches him how to take the next step. I expect to see him by Christmas as I think we’ve got some older guys who will get banged up this season.
