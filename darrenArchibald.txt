British rock band Coldplay touches down at Vancouver’s BC Place Friday on their A Head Full of Dreams tour.

The 123-show outing has taken the band around the world since their latest album was release in 2016, with shows returning to larger venues and stadiums than on their most recent tour. The band also announced that at the conclusion of the tour in November, they plan to release a live album with recordings taken from various concerts.
