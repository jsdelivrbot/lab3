Yet another driver has been nabbed by the West Vancouver Police for being too fast, too furious.

The West Vancouver Police shared details of the latest speed demon to be pulled over in a pair of Twitter posts early Friday morning.

“#wvpdpatrol member impounds another excessive speeder on the Upper Levels Hwy. 19yr old Novice driver stopped for doing 175 in 90km/h zone,” read the tweet.

The driver was issued $700 in fines, while his vehicle was impounded for seven days. Police noted the driver is also responsible for the cost of the tow truck, the impound storage fee “and the long taxi ride home.”

Earlier this summer, another young driver also landed on West Vancouver Police’s radar for excessive speeding.


Yihao Wang of West Vancouver was first pulled over in April 2017 for excessive speeding, before again being caught — by the same officer in the same area — in early July. Wang had been caught hitting 210 km/h exiting the Lions Gate Bridge northbound, where the speed limit slows down to 50 kilometres.

Following the second incident, the 22-year-old man was banned from driving for 16 months, while his 2015 Ferrari 458 was impounded for 60 days.
