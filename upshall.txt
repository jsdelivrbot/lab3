Canucks release Upshall, contemplate Rodin and Juolevi
SEPTEMBER 29, 2017, 12:36 PM | CAT SILVERMAN
As opening night grows ever closer, the Vancouver Canucks have made another round of cuts – although this one almost left behind more questions than answers.

The team confirmed on Twitter that Anton Rodin, Olli Juolevi, and Scottie Upshall have all been cut from preseason, with Upshall getting released from his pro tryout contract and the other two looking for reassignment options.

In theory, it should be an easy step for the team to assign their prospects and lower-tier players to other clubs, but the Canucks have a nasty habit of dealing with complicated situations. Here’s what they had to say about this round of cuts:

Holm heading to Utica and Upshall heading back to free agency are the easy ones. The other two, on the other hand, aren’t so clear.

Rodin still needs to clear waivers before he heads anywhere, but he seems to be having an issue with his work visa to begin with. He would need a US visa to head to Utica, so he’s currently practicing with the UBC Thunderbirds rather than heading for New York. If that delays things for him, he could be stuck in BC a bit longer, even if he clears waivers.

Then, there’s Juolevi.

He could head back to the London Knights for another season, but he seems to be stuck in that in-between grey area where there isn’t as much to learn there, but he doesn’t seem quite ready for the NHL.

The team could send him overseas, though, as well, where Ryan Biech has suggested TPS would be a good fit based on preexisting Vancouver connections:

For now, though, it looks like the team is ready to get their roster finalized for opening night, and they’re making quick work of it.

We all know that either the Flames or Leafs will pick up Rodin given their affinity for Canucks leftovers. Hopefully the Leafs don’t let him rot in the press box and ruin another promising career.

Rodin was the SHL player of the year, right before injury took him out. I’m no GM, but I’m baffled he would hit waivers over some of the folks who are left. Would love to see what he can or can’t do.

They’re trying to get Rodin through now while teams are still making decisions on their own bubble guys, rather than wait for final cutdowns. Hope that it works but would not be shocked if he winds up elsewhere.

It’s the same ‘sneak-through’ they did with Markstrom. Play him away from eyes (he wasn’t supposed to suit up vs. Calgary, but…) and sneak him through waivers while everyone is busy.

Frankly, I’m suprised. I thought he was either on the big club, or going back to Sweden. But apparently, he feels he’s so close that he can taste it, and is going to do what he needs to do to break through. Good luck to ‘im.

The only way this makes sense to me is if they’re about to claim someone off waivers.

I often question the quality of articles on CA, but news do get posted in a timely fashion, so thanks for that.

I still have high hopes for Anton Rodin, hope he clears. He hasn’t played for a long time, so Utica is probably the best thing for him. Play lots, get his game back, and make sure that wonky knee can stay healthy.

I have a feeling if his leg didn’t get injured he would have turned into a strong middle 6’er for us, now it’s better he just needs a few months playing to find his mojo again. I will be peeved if someone claims him and then he finds his mojo.

Agreed. This is the first roster move I’m opposed to. Goldobin and Holm are waiver exempt and both needed to show more to stick. Boucher wasn’t worth agonizing over if we lost him. Rodin, on the other hand, has enough pedigree from his overseas work and limited showing here to make me nervous about losing him and regretting it.

I think he shows good hockey sense and doesn’t hurt you on the ice, and we’ve seen flashes of his skill.

Vegas in particular should be rolling the dice on a player like Rodin. I don’t think it’s that big a stretch to think this guy could pot 20 goals in a featured role. Let’s hope we find out with him in Canuck colours.

Ultimately, if we lose him I’m going to pass judgement on management based on who they chose to keep around instead. I’d have waived Dorsett, Weircoch, Burmistrov et al before Rodin, but you can make a case for each of them. There are others who will make me irate if they stick (Megna, Chaput, I’m looking in your direction). Finally, there are moves such as keeping Pedan on D and protecting needed defensive depth where I will accept the trade-off.

Olli needs to play against men, not teenagers.
Should go to Finland and be given firm goals for the year. If he succeeds and keeps a good attitude, he’ll be a Canuck next year.

Does Juolevi need a ride to the airport? Really, should have been in Finland a week ago.

Sad to see the Canucks let Rodin hit the waiver wire. I believe if he had regular shifts, by the end of the season, he’d be one of those pleasant surprises a la Granlund last year.

I didn’t expect Rodin to hit the wire. Either they’re really considering Archibald or they’re going to carry 13 forwards and 8 defencemen. OJ should have been in Finland for the start of their season.

Is there a list of who’s left in camp?

Agree – curious to see Rodin waived over Arch ( although I like Arch ). If Juolevi goes back to OHL, fear he’ll regress.

I saw Archibald last night. Work ethic is fine, but it could be seen why he’s a 27 year old 5 year AHL vet. Notwithstanding that, it was a nice goal last night and he wheeled in pretty good.

Green compared Rodin to Baertschi last year in terms of skill etc, and that was on one knee. I think this will be a short term assignment for Rodin to get some games and log lots of ice.

Send the guy to Finland and let him marinate already.

Sure, let’s send a top five pick to marinate for a couple years in Finland. Then let’s send him to Utica for another two just in case, to marinate some more… no point in rushing him. That’ll only be six years wrapped in cotton wool marinating, bless his cotton socks.

Hey Juolevi, be good enough to play D in the NHL now kid like Sergachev, McAvoy and Chychrun are, all picked below you, or be gone.

Joke pick by a joke franchise.

Tortoise and the Hare, man. It’s all about the long game. Did all those that had a 20-year old Virtanen written off, now all get back onboard the bandwagon? Did Stefan, Havlat, Comrie, etc. all turn out better than the Sedins? Datysuk & Zetterberg toiled in the minors. Sam Gagner became a minor-leaguer in his 26-year old prime and is now looked as a 4th liner… list goes on. Have some patience. We’re not going anywhere for awhile.

So your logic is, whoever plays games first in the NHL, is always the better player and the better choice to make?

Really? You’re going with that as your logic?
